## How to run app
By default when running via docker compose the app runs with prod profile.
### In prod mode
1. You should have java (jdk) installed
1. Pull source code and go to the project root fodler: `words-app`
2. Set env vars:
    * `BACKEND_DATASOURCE_LOCAL_URL=jdbc:postgresql://<HOST>:<PORT>/<DATABASE>` - you need to specify the postgres connection string. Usually HOST is `localhost`, PORT is `5432` and the DATABASE is `postgres`
    * `POSTGRES_LOCAL_USERNAME=<USERNAME>` - your postgres user. Note that app will fail if specified user hasn't got enough privileges above <DATABASE>
    * `POSTGRES_LOCAL_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>` - your user's password
    * `BACKEND_LOCAL_PORT=<PORT>` - the port app should start on.
3. To start full process of building app (including testing, making build file) run: `./docker_compose_run.sh`. Otherwise, if you done it previously, run `docker compose up`
